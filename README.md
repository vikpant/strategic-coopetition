**Computational Game Theory | Multi-Agent Systems | Strategic Coopetition | Reinforcement Learning**

Faculty of Information, University of Toronto

#### Research Program
I develop computational techniques for modeling strategic coopetition 
by formalizing how actors cooperate and compete simultaneously in multi-agent systems. 
My research bridges conceptual modeling with computational game theory 
and reinforcement learning.

#### Current Projects
- 📄 **strategic-coopetition**: Computational frameworks for interdependence, 
  complementarity, trust, reciprocity, and loyalty.
